# Generator Webpack ES6 SASS

A super minimal generator to scaffold a SASS and ES6 enabled project structure with a very low dependency load.

You have to install Yeoman and the generator globally:

```
$ npm install -g yo
$ npm install -g generator-webpack-es6-sass
```

And then scaffold your project:

```
$ mkdir my-new-project
$ cd my-new-project
$ yo webpack-es6-sass
? Your project name My new project
```

That's it.
